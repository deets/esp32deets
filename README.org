* ESP32 Snippets

This repo contains my ESP32 snippets. It's set up as a
=component=. Please check the official ESP32 SDK documentation for details.

** Quickstart

In your ESP32 project create a subdirectory =components=. GIT clone this
repository in there (either directly, or better as submodule).

Then the code should be available.

** Using U8G2

The amazining [[https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/wiki][U8G2]] library for monochrome OLEDs needs a HAL. I
pilfered the HAL code from [[https://github.com/nkolban/esp32-snippets/][NKolban]]. His code is clearly marked and
APACHE2 licensed.

To use the U8G2 just clone the repository into the =components=
directory.
